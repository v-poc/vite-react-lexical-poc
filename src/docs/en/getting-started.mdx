# Getting Started

## Overview

Thanks to [`vpressify`](https://github.com/v-poc/vpressify) that could support `React docs+demos` well to run with `vite`.

**Lexical** - An extensible text editor framework that does things differently:

- Reliable
  - Lexical is comprised of editor instances that each attach to a single content editable element. A set of editor states represent the current and pending states of the editor at any given time.
- Accessible
  - Lexical is designed for everyone. It follows best practices established in WCAG and is compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Fast
  - Lexical is minimal. It doesn't directly concern itself with UI components, toolbars or rich-text features and markdown. The logic for these features can be included via a plugin interface.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm i
```
